## 🛠️ Local Development Guide

If you're more comfortable using your own development environment, you're absolutely welcome to do that. Just make sure Node.js and npm are set up on your machine.

> 💡 I personally recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) — it makes managing Node versions super easy.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository using Git.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
